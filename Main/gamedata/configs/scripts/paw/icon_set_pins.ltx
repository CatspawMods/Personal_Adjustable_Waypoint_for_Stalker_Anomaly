; It's best to leave the default groups 
; alone, although you can delete this file 
; if you never want to see this set again.
; 
; You can customize this if you like, or 
; even create your own, but the Favorites 
; group (icon_set_faves.ltx) is always 
; displayed at the top of MCM, and you'll
; lose any changes to default sets when 
; updating/reinstalling PAW. Be sure to 
; back up any sets you customize.
